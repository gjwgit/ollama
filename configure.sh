# Script Name: configure.sh
# Description: 
#   This script performs the necessary installation for the health_rag MLHub package.
#   It checks if Ollama is installed on the system. If not, it prompts the user for 
#   permission to install it. Upon successful installation, it downloads the LLaMA 3.2 1B
#   and nomic-embed-text models using Ollama.
